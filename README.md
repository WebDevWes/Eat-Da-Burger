How to use: Add a burger by typing in a name for the burger. When Eaten is clicked, the column of devoured for the burger selected will be designated as true, and will be displayed in the second table. Each table determines whether something is "Eaten" through the use of connection.query. Clicking throw away will delete the selected burger from the table.
